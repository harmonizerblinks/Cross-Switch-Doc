# Payment

## Creating a MoMo Payment

{% swagger src="../../.gitbook/assets/Sandbox.postman_collection.json" path="/pet" method="post" %}
[Sandbox.postman_collection.json](../../.gitbook/assets/Sandbox.postman_collection.json)
{% endswagger %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** This API method was created using the API Method block, it's how you can build out an API method documentation from scratch. Have a play with the block and you'll see you can do some nifty things like add and reorder parameters, document responses, and give your methods detailed descriptions.

## Callback

{% swagger src="https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json" path="/pet" method="put" %}
[https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json](https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json)
{% endswagger %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** This API method was auto-generated from an example Swagger file. You'll see that it's not editable â€“ that's because the contents are synced to an URL! Any time the linked file changes, the documentation will change too.
